1. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think it's because all the files in a repository relate to each other.

2. git log: view all git history
git diff id-1 id-2: compare two histories 

3. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
commit
